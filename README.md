<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This project proposes the development of a programming library focused on the study, teaching and learning of mobile robotics concepts based on a real implementation model. The presented work seeks the representation of concepts in educational robotics and advanced robotics under a framework of practicality and simplification that serves as a tool for the study of more complex theories. The development process covers the creation, verification, validation, and implementation of programming functions based on Python language as the programming code base.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The development of the PyCore_Robot system libraries consists of various sub-libraries focused on different areas of robotics study. Currently, one of them is at a fairly advanced stage of development.

* UcoRobot: Library focused on real-time positioning data acquisition tools in controlled environments using ArUco markers from the Python OpenCV library (currently in development).

* RoverRobot: Library focused on the control and monitoring of medium-sized autonomous robotic units in outdoor environments (in projection).

* AirRobot: Library focused on the control of aerial robotic units, both indoors and outdoors (in projection).

* ChallengeRobot: Library focused on the control of robotic competition units in their various categories (in projection).

### Prerequisites

UcoRobot (ArUco Marker based Mobile
Robotics Library for Autonomous Systems) prerequisites.

![OpenCV](https://img.shields.io/badge/opencv-%23white.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=opencv&logoColor=white)

* opencv-python
  ```sh
  pip install opencv-python
  ```

* opencv-contrib-python
  ```sh
  pip install opencv-contrib-python
  ```

![NumPy](https://img.shields.io/badge/numpy-%23013243.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=numpy&logoColor=white)

* numpy
  ```sh
  pip install numpy
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The UcoRobot library primarily employs image processing as a means to calculate kinematic aspects such as position, orientation, and velocity. To achieve this, it is essential to perform proper camera calibration. In the specific case of the library, an upper peripheral camera is used to obtain real-time parameters.

Initialize UcoRobot:

```sh
import ucorobot
```

First, for UcoRobot initial calibration use:

```sh
ucorobot.calibration()
```

Use the chessboard method to calibrate your camera.

[![chessboard_method][chessboard_method]](https://example.com)

You can select your chessboard from [here](https://markhedleyjones.com/projects/calibration-checkerboard-collection).

Next, you need to generate ArUco markers for your robots. You can use this [page](https://fodi.github.io/arucosheetgen/).

Now, you need to assign your functional markers:

```sh
ucorobot.assign()
```
And from here you can use all functions.

_Please refer to the [Examples](https://github.com/Epic-Robotics/pyCore-robot/)_ for more details.
